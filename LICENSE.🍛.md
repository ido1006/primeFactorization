## "THE CURRY&RICE-WARE LICENSE"

As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff.
If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a **üçõ Curry & Rice üçõ** in return.

(This license is based on ["THE SUSHI-WARE LICENSE"] and ["THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42)].
 Thanks a lot, MakeNowJust and Poul-Henning Kamp!)
